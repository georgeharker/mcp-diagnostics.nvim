We are developing a plugin together for mcp.  Read ./analysis/progress_tracking/README.md and ./analysis/progress_tracking/RESUME_TESTING_SESSION.md

We're going to debug and fix some code you wrote as a test.

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

I'll help you debug and fix the code. Let me first read the progress tracking files to understand what we've been working on.

Read file `./analysis/progress_tracking/README.md`


Read file `./analysis/progress_tracking/RESUME_TESTING_SESSION.md`


Now I understand the context! We've been developing an MCP diagnostics plugin for Neovim, and we've completed two comprehensive cleanup sessions that achieved zero diagnostics. We're now ready to start a testing session to verify the functionality works properly.

From what I can see, we need to:

1. **Test edit reflection** - Make sure edits through MCP tools actually change files
2. **Test LSP refresh timing** - Develop reliable methods to wait for diagnostic updates
3. **Test external change handling** - Verify the enhanced file watcher system works
4. **Test mixed workflows** - Combine MCP edits with external tools like sed/patch

Let me start by checking what specific testing materials or problematic code you've prepared for us to debug and fix. Are there any specific files you'd like me to examine, or should I look for test files that were mentioned in the progress tracking?

Searched files for `**/test_*`, 3 results
```
test_enhanced_file_watcher.lua
server/mcp-diagnostics/test_connection.js
server/mcp-diagnostics/test_tcp_connection.js
```


Searched files for `**/*debug*`, no results


Read file `test_enhanced_file_watcher.lua`


Perfect! I can see you have a test file prepared. This looks like the code we need to debug and test. Let me also check what the current diagnostics situation is by accessing the MCP diagnostics tools to see what issues we're dealing with.

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"info":0,"total":0,"hints":0,"bySource":[],"byFile":[],"errors":0,"files":0,"warnings":0}
````


Excellent! We have zero diagnostics currently, which matches the progress tracking indicating we achieved a clean state. Now let me check the current buffer/workspace status and then run the test file to see what issues come up.

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````

````


Let me first ensure the test file is loaded and see if we can run it to identify the issues:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"loaded_files":[{"loaded":17,"file":"test_enhanced_file_watcher.lua"}],"message":"Loaded 1 files for LSP analysis"}
````


Now let me check if there are any diagnostics in the test file:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
[]
````


Interesting! The test file has no diagnostics. Let me actually try to run the test file to see what happens and identify potential runtime issues. Let me first check if this is meant to be executed as a standalone Lua script or within Neovim:

`lua test_enhanced_file_watcher.lua` error

==========================================
```


Ah, I see the issue! The test file is written to use `require()` as if it's running within the Neovim/Lua environment where the plugin modules would be loaded, but it's being run as a standalone Lua script. This is a **module path resolution issue**.

Let me examine the actual file structure to understand how the modules should be loaded:

Wait that's not the experiment - we want to look in analysis/test-session for a python program, which you should have left yourself notes on

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

Ah, you're absolutely right! Let me look for the actual test session materials in the analysis/test-session directory. I should have left notes about a Python program there.

```


Perfect! There's the test session with Python files. Let me read the README first to understand what we're testing:

Read file `analysis/test_session/README.md`


Excellent! Now I understand. We have a complete Python dotfile manager application with intentional linting issues for testing our MCP diagnostics system. Let me examine the Python files to see what issues we're dealing with:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


Perfect! Now I can see the intentional linting issues in this file. Let me also check the other Python files to get the full picture:

Read file `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`


Great! Now let me also check the main dotfile_manager.py to get the complete picture:

Read file `analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py`


Now let me start by loading these test files into the MCP system to see what diagnostics we get:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"loaded_files":[{"loaded":25,"file":"analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"},{"loaded":26,"file":"analysis/test_session/config_handler.py"},{"loaded":27,"file":"analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py"}],"message":"Loaded 3 files for LSP analysis"}
````


Perfect! The files are loaded. Now let's check what diagnostics we have:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"info":5,"total":33,"hints":0,"bySource":{"mypy":31,"Lua Diagnostics.":2},"byFile":{"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/lua/mcp-diagnostics/init.lua":{"warnings":2,"errors":0,"hints":0,"info":0},"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py":{"warnings":0,"errors":6,"hints":0,"info":0},"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/config_handler.py":{"warnings":0,"errors":13,"hints":0,"info":4},"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py":{"warnings":0,"errors":7,"hints":0,"info":1}},"errors":26,"files":4,"warnings":2}
````


Excellent! We have a good collection of diagnostics to work with:
- **26 errors** total
- **2 warnings** 
- **5 info** items
- **33 total** diagnostics

The Python files have the issues as expected:
- `file_utils.py`: 6 errors
- `config_handler.py`: 13 errors + 4 info
- `dotfile_manager.py`: 7 errors + 1 info

Let me get the detailed diagnostics to see what we're working with:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````


Perfect! Now I have a clear picture of the testing scenario. We have intentionally buggy Python code with various types of issues:

**From file_utils.py:**
- Type annotation issues with dictionaries
- Missing type annotations
- Return type mismatches

**From config_handler.py:**
- Missing type stubs for yaml/toml
- None assignment to typed variables
- Missing method attributes on generic objects
- Missing type annotations

This is an excellent testing environment! Now let me start **systematically fixing these issues** to test our MCP diagnostics workflow. I'll begin with the `file_utils.py` issues since they seem more straightforward.

Let me start by examining the specific problematic code sections:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
[]
````


Let me look at the specific problematic lines to understand the context:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


Let me get more context around the error - line 53 is the `return info` statement:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


Now I understand the first issue! The function signature says it returns `Dict[str, Union[str, int, float]]` but the dictionary includes boolean values (from `is_file()`, `is_dir()`, `is_symlink()`). Let me fix this:

Edited `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`
Fix the return type annotation to include bool for the file type checking booleans


Great! Now let's check the next error around line 163. Let me examine that area:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


Let me find the compare_files function to understand the context:

Searched text for `def compare_files`, 1 results
```
file_utils.py:152 analysis/test_session
```


Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


I see the issue! The function declares that it returns `Dict[str, Union[bool, str]]`, but it initializes `error` as `None` which is neither bool nor str. Let me fix this:

Edited `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`
Fix the return type annotation to include Optional[str] or None, and initialize error field properly


Let me also check the line 182 error which is similar:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


Good, so line 182 is the `result['error'] = str(e)` line which is now fine since we updated the type annotation to include `None`.

Now let me check the last error around line 281 - the missing type annotation for `config`:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


I found it! Line 281 is the `config = {}` line. Let me add the type annotation:

Edited `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`
Add type annotation for the config variable


Excellent! Now let me check if the file_utils.py diagnostics have been resolved by waiting a moment and then checking diagnostics:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````

````


Interesting! I can see that:

1. The type annotation issue on line 281 is fixed (no longer in the error list)
2. But we still have issues that need more detailed fixing
3. There's a new error from Ruff about `undefined_variable_name` - which is one of the intentional bugs!

Let me try to refresh the diagnostics to see if LSP has caught up with our changes:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 1 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


Great! The new file watcher system is working. Let me wait a moment and check diagnostics again:

`sleep 2`
```

```


**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
[{"col":11,"severityText":"error","severity":1,"source":"mypy","lnum":53,"bufnr":25,"end_lnum":53,"message":"Incompatible return value type (got \"dict[str, object]\", expected \"dict[str, str | int | float | bool]\")","end_col":15,"filename":"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py","code":"return-value"},{"col":30,"severityText":"error","severity":1,"source":"mypy","lnum":163,"bufnr":25,"end_lnum":163,"message":"Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", target has type \"bool | None\")","end_col":62,"filename":"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py","code":"assignment"},{"col":19,"severityText":"error","severity":1,"source":"mypy","lnum":164,"bufnr":25,"end_lnum":164,"message":"Incompatible return value type (got \"dict[str, bool | None]\", expected \"dict[str, bool | str | None]\")","end_col":25,"filename":"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py","code":"return-value"},{"col":26,"severityText":"error","severity":1,"source":"mypy","lnum":182,"bufnr":25,"end_lnum":182,"message":"Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", target has type \"bool | None\")","end_col":32,"filename":"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py","code":"assignment"},{"col":11,"severityText":"error","severity":1,"source":"mypy","lnum":184,"bufnr":25,"end_lnum":184,"message":"Incompatible return value type (got \"dict[str, bool | None]\", expected \"dict[str, bool | str | None]\")","end_col":17,"filename":"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py","code":"return-value"}]
````


I see the issue still persists. Looking more carefully at the error messages, the problem is more complex. Let me examine what's causing the `dict[str, object]` issue on line 53:

The error says we're returning `dict[str, object]` but expecting `dict[str, str | int | float | bool]`. This suggests that some of the values in the dictionary are being inferred as `object` rather than the specific types we expect. 

The issue is likely that `mimetypes.guess_type()` or some other function returns a more generic type. Let me look at that code again and add more specific type hints:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


The issue is that `mimetypes.guess_type()` returns `Optional[str]`, and even with `or 'unknown'`, mypy might not be inferring the exact type. Let me be more explicit:

Edited `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`
Make the mime_type assignment more explicit to help mypy understand the type


Now let me try a different approach by being even more explicit with the types. The issue might be that mypy isn't able to narrow down the exact types in the dictionary comprehension. Let me test our **external edit detection** capability by using `sed` to make a targeted fix:

`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/UNUSED_CONSTANT = "This will trigger unused variable warning"/# UNUSED_CONSTANT = "Fixed unused variable warning"/' file_utils.py`
```

```


Great! Now let me test the external change detection:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Found 1 potentially stale files","stale_files":["analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


Excellent! The enhanced file watcher system detected the external change. Now let me refresh:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 1 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


Perfect! Let me also fix the undefined variable issue using `sed`:

`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/return undefined_variable_name/return "fixed_variable_value"/' file_utils.py`
```

```


Let me refresh again and check the diagnostics:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 1 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````

Great! I notice the undefined variable error is gone, but we still have the type annotation issues. This is perfect for testing! Let me now **demonstrate the mixed workflow** by fixing some issues with MCP tools and others with external commands.

The persistent mypy errors are related to the `compare_files` function. Let me examine the issue more carefully. The problem is on lines 163 and 182 where we assign strings to fields that were initialized with different types.

Looking at the error messages:
- Line 163: `expression has type "str", target has type "bool | None"`
- Line 182: Same issue

This suggests that we're trying to assign a string to a dictionary key that was expected to hold a boolean or None. Let me look at what's happening:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


Ah! The issue is that line 163 is `result['error'] = "One or both files do not exist"`, and mypy thinks the 'error' key should be `bool | None` instead of `str | None`. The issue is in the type annotation.

Let me check what the initial dictionary structure looks like:

Read file `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`


I see the issue now! The problem is that mypy is inferring the type of `result` from its initial values, and it sees:
- `'files_exist'` as `bool`
- `'same_size'` as `bool` 
- `'same_content'` as `bool`
- `'same_permissions'` as `bool`
- `'error'` as `None`

So mypy thinks all the values should be `bool | None`, but we're trying to assign strings to the `'error'` key. I need to be more explicit about the typing of this dictionary:

Edited `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`
Fix the compare_files function by being more explicit about the result dictionary types


Now let me refresh and check if this resolves the remaining type issues:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 1 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


`sleep 2`
```

```


**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
[{"col":11,"severityText":"error","severity":1,"source":"mypy","lnum":53,"bufnr":25,"end_lnum":53,"message":"Incompatible return value type (got \"dict[str, object]\", expected \"dict[str, str | int | float | bool]\")","end_col":15,"filename":"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py","code":"return-value"}]
````


Excellent progress! We went from 6 errors to just 1 error in `file_utils.py`. The `compare_files` function issues are resolved. 

Now we just have the persistent issue with `get_file_info` on line 53. The problem is still that mypy sees `dict[str, object]` instead of the expected specific types. Let me take a different approach and be very explicit about constructing this dictionary:

Edited `analysis/test_session/file_utils.py`
Restructure get_file_info to be more explicit about types and avoid the object inference issue


**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 1 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


`sleep 2`
```

```


**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
[]
````


🎉 **EXCELLENT!** We've successfully eliminated ALL diagnostics from `file_utils.py`! 

Let me verify this and check our overall progress:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now let me tackle the `config_handler.py` issues to demonstrate more complex diagnostic patterns. This file has different types of issues:

1. **Missing type stubs** (yaml, toml libraries)
2. **Type annotation issues**  
3. **Generic object attribute errors**

Let me start with config_handler.py:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````


Perfect! Now I have a clear list of issues. Let me demonstrate **mixed workflows** by fixing some with MCP tools and others with external commands:

### Using `sed` to fix the simple type annotation issue:

`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/config_cache = {}/config_cache: Dict[str, Any] = {}/' config_handler.py`
```

```


### Using MCP tools to fix the dataclass default assignment issues:

Read file `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`


The issue is that `List[str] = None` is incompatible - we need to use `Optional[List[str]]` or provide proper defaults. Let me fix this:

Edited `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`
Fix the dataclass field type annotations to use Optional or proper defaults


Now let me check and refresh diagnostics:

````


Great! We eliminated 3 errors (went from 13 to 10). Now let me tackle the "object has no attribute append" errors. These are happening because mypy can't determine that the objects have a `.append()` method. Let me look at those lines:

Read file `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`


I see the issue. Let me look at where `result` is defined:

Read file `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`


The issue is that mypy can't infer that `result['errors']` and `result['warnings']` are lists from the empty list `[]` initialization. I should add explicit typing. Let me fix this using MCP tools:

Edited `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`
Fix the validate_yaml function by adding explicit type annotations for the result dictionary


Now let me fix the validate_json function similarly:

Read file `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`


Edited `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`
Fix the validate_json function with explicit type annotations


Now let me also fix the validate_shell_script function:

Read file `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`


Edited `analysis/test_session/config_handler.py`
Fix the validate_shell_script function with explicit type annotations


Now let me refresh and check the progress:

Oops! I created a syntax error with the type comments. The inline type comments I used are not valid in that context. Let me fix this by using a different approach:

🎉 **Excellent progress!** We went from **10 errors to just 2 errors** in config_handler.py! The explicit type annotations resolved all the "object has no attribute append" issues.

Now we're left with just the **library stubs** errors for `yaml` and `toml`. These are common in Python projects and typically resolved by either:

1. Installing type stub packages (`pip install types-pyyaml types-toml`)
2. Adding type: ignore comments  
3. Adding mypy configuration to ignore missing stubs

Let me demonstrate fixing these with **external commands** using `sed`:

`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/import yaml/import yaml  # type: ignore/' config_handler.py`
```

```


`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/import toml/import toml  # type: ignore/' config_handler.py`

Perfect! I can see we have two types of issues:

1. **Missing Textual library stubs** (6 errors) - similar to what we fixed with yaml/toml
2. **Missing type annotation** (1 error) - simple fix

Great! So we have **6 unused import warnings**. Let's tackle both the errors and warnings systematically.

**Strategy:**
1. Fix the Textual import errors with `# type: ignore` (external commands)
2. Fix the type annotation error (MCP tools)
3. Clean up unused imports (mixed approach)

Let's start with the import stub issues using **external commands**:

`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/from textual.app import App, ComposeResult/from textual.app import App, ComposeResult  # type: ignore/' dotfile_manager.py`
```

```



## Me

> Context:

> - <group>full_stack_dev</group>

Actually, some side comments - we can create a mypy.ini file... that's good for removing stub errors.  Also I'll just go and make the env and make it active. give me a sec

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

Great idea! Creating a `mypy.ini` file is a much cleaner approach than adding `# type: ignore` comments everywhere. And having the proper environment with the actual libraries installed will resolve the import-not-found errors naturally.

Let me pause here while you set up the environment. A proper `mypy.ini` file can handle:

- Missing library stubs globally
- Specific ignore patterns  
- Type checking strictness levels
- Per-module configurations

This will be a much more realistic testing scenario since most Python projects have proper mypy configuration and virtual environments with dependencies installed.

Take your time setting up the environment - I'll wait for your signal to continue!

## Me

> Context:
> - <group>mcp</group>
> - <group>full_stack_dev</group>

Ok, we should have an active venv, go ahead


## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

Excellent! Now that we have an active venv, let's create a proper `mypy.ini` file first and then continue with the fixes. This will be much cleaner than adding type ignore comments everywhere.

Created file `analysis/test_session/mypy.ini`
```ini
[mypy]
# Basic mypy configuration for the dotfile manager project
python_version = 3.8
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True
disallow_untyped_defs = False
disallow_incomplete_defs = False

# Handle missing library stubs gracefully
ignore_missing_imports = True

# Specific module configurations
[mypy-textual.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True

[mypy-rich.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True

[mypy-yaml]
ignore_missing_imports = True

[mypy-toml]
ignore_missing_imports = True
```



## Me

> Context:
> - <group>mcp</group>
> - <group>full_stack_dev</group>

wait a sec, I changed dir.  Try again, now you should be good

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

Perfect! Now let me create the mypy.ini file in the test_session directory:

Created file `analysis/test_session/mypy.ini`
```ini
[mypy]
# Basic mypy configuration for the dotfile manager project
python_version = 3.8
warn_return_any = True
warn_unused_configs = True
disallow_untyped_defs = False
disallow_incomplete_defs = False

# Handle missing library stubs gracefully
ignore_missing_imports = True

# Specific module configurations
[mypy-textual.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True

[mypy-rich.*]
ignore_missing_imports = True

[mypy-yaml]
ignore_missing_imports = True

[mypy-toml]
ignore_missing_imports = True
```


Great! Now let me also revert the type: ignore comments I added earlier since we have proper mypy configuration:

`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/import yaml  # type: ignore/import yaml/' config_handler.py`
```

```


`cd analysis/test_session && sed -i '' 's/import toml  # type: ignore/import toml/' config_handler.py`
```

```


Now let me refresh the diagnostics and see how the mypy.ini affects our error count:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 2 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/config_handler.py","analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


Let me ensure all the Python files are loaded and refreshed:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"loaded_files":[{"loaded":27,"file":"analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py"},{"loaded":26,"file":"analysis/test_session/config_handler.py"},{"loaded":25,"file":"analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"}],"message":"Loaded 3 files for LSP analysis"}
````


`sleep 3`
```

```


Now let's check the diagnostics:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"info":1,"total":15,"hints":0,"bySource":{"Lua Diagnostics.":2,"mypy":13},"byFile":{"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/lua/mcp-diagnostics/init.lua":{"warnings":2,"errors":0,"hints":0,"info":0},"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/file_utils.py":{"warnings":1,"errors":0,"hints":0,"info":0},"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/config_handler.py":{"warnings":1,"errors":0,"hints":0,"info":0},"/Users/geohar/Development/ext/mcp-diagnostics.nvim/analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py":{"warnings":0,"errors":10,"hints":0,"info":1}},"errors":10,"files":4,"warnings":4}

Interesting! The mypy.ini had a significant impact. Let me check the remaining errors in dotfile_manager.py:

````


The mypy.ini didn't take effect for some reason. Let me try a different approach - perhaps mypy needs to be restarted or the configuration needs to be in the right place. Let me check if the libraries are actually installed in the venv:

`pip list | grep -E "(rich|textual|yaml|toml)"`
```
rich                    14.1.0
textual                 6.1.0
toml                    0.10.2
```


Great! The libraries are installed. The issue might be that mypy is running from a different location or the LSP server hasn't picked up the new mypy.ini file. Let me try installing the requirements.txt first:

Read file `analysis/test_session/requirements.txt`


Let me install the requirements and then try a more direct approach by updating the mypy.ini with more specific settings:

The user rejected the execution of the command `pip install -r analysis/test_session/requirements.txt`?



## Me

> Context:
> - <group>mcp</group>
> - <group>full_stack_dev</group>

I suspect mypy.ini has to be at the top of the source tree

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

You're absolutely right! Mypy looks for configuration files starting from the current working directory and walking up the tree. Let me move the mypy.ini to the project root:

`mv analysis/test_session/mypy.ini ./mypy.ini`
```

```


Now let me refresh the diagnostics to see if mypy picks up the configuration:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 2 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/config_handler.py","analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


Let me ensure all files are reloaded:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"loaded_files":[{"loaded":27,"file":"analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py"},{"loaded":26,"file":"analysis/test_session/config_handler.py"},{"loaded":25,"file":"analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"}],"message":"Loaded 3 files for LSP analysis"}
````


`sleep 3`
```

```


**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
[]
````


🎉 **EXCELLENT!** The mypy.ini configuration worked perfectly! All the import errors are gone from dotfile_manager.py.

Let me check the overall status:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````

We're getting close! Let me check what the remaining 4 errors are:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````


Great! Now I can see the issues clearly:

1. **Python version error** - mypy.ini specifies Python 3.8 but needs 3.9+
2. **Missing type annotations** (2 cases)  
3. **Type compatibility issue** with Panel/Widget

Let me fix these:

**1. Fix the Python version in mypy.ini:**

Edited `mypy.ini`
Update Python version in mypy.ini to 3.9


**2. Fix the type annotation issues:**

Let me look at the problematic lines:

Read file `analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py`


Read file `analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py`


Now I can fix the type annotations:

Edited `analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py`
Add type annotations for managed_files and table variables


**3. Now let me check the Panel/Widget compatibility issue around line 318:**

Read file `analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py`


I see the issue. The `Panel` from Rich is being used inside a Textual `Container`, but Textual expects `Widget` objects. This is a type compatibility issue. In modern Textual, we should use Textual's own widgets. Let me fix this by replacing the `Panel` with a `Static` widget:

Edited `analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py`
Replace Rich Panel with Textual Static widget to fix type compatibility


Now let me refresh and check our progress:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````

You had to use sleeps to be sure of refreshes.  How would we update the code to not have to do that?

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

Great question! The `sleep` commands are a crude workaround for LSP timing issues. Let's make the system more robust by implementing proper **event-driven waiting** and **diagnostic state monitoring**.

Here are the key improvements we should implement:

## 🔧 **Enhanced LSP Refresh Strategy**

### 1. **Event-Based Waiting Instead of Sleep**

Read file `lua/mcp-diagnostics/shared/lsp_extra.lua`


Let me add a proper **diagnostic state monitoring** function:

Edited `lua/mcp-diagnostics/shared/lsp_extra.lua`
Add diagnostic state monitoring functions to avoid sleep-based waiting


### 2. **Event-Driven LSP Client Monitoring**

Let me also add LSP client event monitoring:

Edited `lua/mcp-diagnostics/shared/lsp_extra.lua`
Add LSP client event monitoring for more reliable timing


### 3. **Update MCP Tools to Use Smart Waiting**

Now let me update the MCP tools to use these new functions:

Read file `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`


Let me update the refresh tools to use the new smart waiting:

Searched text for `register_file_refresh_tools`, 2 results
```
tools_extra.lua:24 lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub
tools_extra.lua:338 lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub
```


Read file `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`


Now let me update the refresh tools to use the new smart waiting functionality:

Edited `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`
Update refresh tools to use smart waiting instead of relying on sleep timing


### 4. **Add New Smart Waiting MCP Tool**

Let me add a dedicated tool for waiting for diagnostic updates:

Edited `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`
Add new smart waiting MCP tool for diagnostic monitoring


### 5. **Update File Loading to Include Smart Waiting**

Searched text for `ensure_files_loaded`, 4 results
```
tools_extra.lua:188 lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub
tools_extra.lua:190 lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub
tools_extra.lua:276 lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub
tools_extra.lua:298 lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub
```


Error reading `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`
Invalid line range - start_line_number_base_zero (275) comes after end_line_number_base_zero (220)


Read file `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`


Let me add an enhanced version that includes smart waiting:

Edited `lua/mcp-diagnostics/mcphub/tools_extra.lua`
Add enhanced file loading with smart diagnostic waiting option


## 🧪 **Testing the New Smart Waiting System**

Now let's test our enhanced system! Let me refresh to pick up the new functionality:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

````
{"message":"Refreshed 3 files","refreshed_files":["analysis/test_session/dotfile_manager.py","analysis/test_session/config_handler.py","analysis/test_session/file_utils.py"]}
````


Actually, let me restart the MCP server to pick up the new tools since we added significant new functionality:

**`use_mcp_tool` Tool**: Returned the following:

# MCP SERVERS

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables communication between the system and locally running MCP servers that provide additional tools and resources to extend your capabilities.

## Connected MCP Servers

When a server is connected, you can use the server's tools via the `use_mcp_tool` tool, and access the server's resources via the `access_mcp_resource` tool.
Note: Server names are case sensitive and you should always use the exact full name like `Firecrawl MCP` or `src/user/main/time-mcp` etc

- edit_file: Replace multiple sections in a file using SEARCH/REPLACE blocks that define exact changes to specific parts of the file. This tool starts an interactive edit session in Neovim. The user might accept some changes, reject some or add new text during the edit session. Once the edit session completes the result will include useful information like diff and feedback which you MUST take into account for SUBSEQUENT conversation: 
  1. A diff comparing the file before and after the edit session. The diff might be a result of a combination of:
     - Changes from successfully applied SEARCH/REPLACE blocks
     - Changes made by the USER during the edit session
     - Changes made by the FORMATTERS or LINTERS that were run before the file is saved
  2. Feedback from the edit session, which might include:
     - Any issues while PARSING the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks and how they were resolved
     - Any issues encountered while FINDING the SEARCH content in the file like:
       - SEARCH content not found (will provide the best match found for the SEARCH content) or
       - SEARCH content found but with fuzzy matching (will provide a confidence score and the diff between SEARCH content and the fuzzy match)
     - Any additional user feedback provided during the edit session
  3. Diagnostics in the file after the edit session is completed
  
  IMPORTANT: The diff will show you what all changes were made, and the feedback will provide additional context on how the SEARCH/REPLACE blocks were applied to avoid any issues in subsequent calls. You MUST give EXTREME care to the result of this tool or else you will be fired!!! 
  IMPORTANT: The tool is NEVER wrong. Once edits are shown in the buffer, user might make any additional changes like adding some new comment or editing the replace text you sent. This MUST be considered as intentional and is not a bug in the tool. Hence, careful observation of the diff and feedback is CRITICAL to avoid any issues in subsequent calls.
  

  Input Schema:

  ```json
  {
    "required": [
      "path",
      "diff"
    ],
    "properties": {
      "path": {
        "description": "The path to the file to modify",

        "description": "One or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks following this exact format:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n[exact content to find]\n=======\n[new content to replace with]\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nCRITICAL: \n- When there are two or more related changes needed in a file, always use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in the diff from the start of the file to the end. Each block should contain the exact content to find and the new content to replace it with. Failing to do so or using multiple calls with single SEARCH/REPLACE block will result in you being fired!!!\n- The markers `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>> REPLACE` MUST be exact with no other characters on the line.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n1. Multiple changes in one call from top to bottom: \n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport os\n=======\nimport os\nimport json\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef process_data():\n    # old implementation\n    pass\n=======\ndef process_data():\n    # new implementation\n    with open('data.json') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(\"Starting\")\n=======\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(\"Starting with new config\")\n    process_data()\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2. Deletion example:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef unused_function():\n    return \"delete me\"\n\n=======\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3. Adding new content at end: \nCAUTION: Whitespaces or newlines without any other content in the SEARCH section will replace the entire file!!! This will lead to loss of all content in the file. Searching for empty lines or whitespace in order to replace something is not allowed. Only use empty SEARCH blocks if you want to replace the ENTIRE file content.\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return result\n\n\n=======\n    return result\n\ndef new_helper_function():\n    return \"helper\"\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n4. Replacing same content multiple times:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ncount = 0\n=======\ncounter = 0\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nprint(\"Count is\", count)\n=======\nprint(\"Counter is\", counter)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nprint(\"Count is\", count)\n=======\nprint(\"Counter is\", counter)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nCRITICAL RULE:\nWhen the SEARCH or REPLACE content includes lines that start with markers like `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, or `>>>>>>>`, you MUST escape them by adding a backslash before each marker so that tool doesn't parse them as actual markers. For example, to search for content that has `<<<<<<< SEARCH`, use `\\<<<<<<< SEARCH` in the SEARCH block.\n\n5. Escaping markers in SEARCH/REPLACE content:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nTutorial:\nA marker has < or > or = in it. E.g\n\\<<<<<<< SEARCH\n=======\nTutorial:\nA marker will have < or > or = in it. e.g\n\\=======\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n\nCRITICAL rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the file section EXACTLY:\n   - Character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n   - Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence\n   - To replace same content multiple times: Use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for each occurrence \n   - When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n   - Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness\n   - Break large blocks into smaller blocks that each change a small portion. Searching for entire functions or large sections when only a few lines need changing will get you fired!!!\n   - Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures\n4. Special operations:\n   - To move code: Use two blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n   - To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\nIMPORTANT: Batch multiple related changes for a file into a single call to minimize user interactions.\n",

## Disabled MCP Servers

When a server is disabled, it will not be able to provide tools or resources. You can start one of the following disabled servers by using the `toggle_mcp_server` tool on `mcphub` MCP Server if it is connected using `use_mcp_tool`

(No disabled MCP servers)

## Examples

### `use_mcp_tool`

When you need to call a tool on an MCP Server, use the `use_mcp_tool` tool:

Pseudocode:

use_mcp_tool
  server_name: string (One of the available server names)
  tool_name: string (name of the tool in the server to call)
  tool_input: object (Arguments for the tool call)

### `access_mcp_resource`

When you need to access a resource from a MCP Server, use the `access_mcp_resource` tool:

Pseudocode:

access_mcp_resource
  server_name: string (One of the available server names)
  uri: string (uri for the resource)

### Toggling a MCP Server

When you need to start a disabled MCP Server or vice-versa, use the `toggle_mcp_server` tool on `mcphub` MCP Server using `use_mcp_tool`:

CRITICAL: You need to use the `use_mcp_tool` tool to call the `toggle_mcp_server` tool on `mcphub` MCP Server when `mcphub` server is "Connected" else ask the user to enable `mcphub` server.

Pseudocode:

use_mcp_tool
  server_name: "mcphub"
  tool_name: "toggle_mcp_server"
  tool_input:
    server_name: string (One of the available server names to start or stop)
    action: string (one of `start` or `stop`)

Perfect! I can see that the MCP server was restarted and I'm seeing the same original tools. That means our new smart waiting functions weren't picked up by the server restart. Let me try to restart the mcp-diagnostics server specifically to get the new functionality:
